Getting Started
===============

Welcome to :ref:`DQMaRC <api.DQMaRC>` (**Data Quality Markup and Ready-to-Connect**). 
:ref:`DQMaRC <api.DQMaRC>` is a Python-based tool for data quality profiling. We are pleased that you are interested to 
learn about :ref:`DQMaRC <api.DQMaRC>` and hope that it is useful for your data quality profiling needs. This guide will provide
you with the foundational knowledge and practical steps needed to get started with :ref:`DQMaRC <api.DQMaRC>`, whether you're a 
seasoned Python programmer or a non-technical user.

What is Data Quality? 
---------------------
Data quality (DQ) refers to the condition of a dataset, assessing whether it meets the needs of its intended use.
High-quality data is critical for effective and accurate decision-making in any field, particularly in healthcare, 
finance, and research. DQ errors are indicative of real-world problems arising from behaviours, processes, or systems.

DQMaRC evaluates data quality across six core dimensions as defined by the Data Management Association (DAMA)

Why Use DQMaRC?
---------------

#. **In-Depth Cell-Level Markup**: DQMaRC generates detailed cell-level markup of DQ issues, allowing precise identification of problematic data directly connected to the source.

#. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Provides custom metrics to evaluate DQ across six key dimensions as defined by DAMA, ensuring a thorough assessment.

#. **Plug-and-Play Functionality**: DQMaRC offers readily available test parameters that allow users to quickly start assessing DQ without extensive setup or configuration.

#. **Easy and Thorough Customisation**: Users can easily customise DQ test parameters either programmatically or in Excel, tailoring the tool to specific needs.

#. **Accessibility**: Designed for both Python programmers and non-technical users, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Shiny for Python, lowering the barrier to entry.

#. **Flexible and Interoperable**: The DQMaRC Python API can be integrated into a diverse range of applications, IT infrastructures, data processing and analysis workflows. 


How does DQMaRC Work: The Role of Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata is data about data. It provides context, meaning, and guidelines on how data should be captured, defined, structured, and represented. Metadata should be comprehensive,
up-to-date, and thorough in its description of how data should be defined, captured, structured, and analysed. 
Robust metadata is the cornerstone of any DQ evaluation process as it forms the foundations of business rules and constraints during DQ assessment. :ref:`DQMaRC <api.DQMaRC>`
uses metadata in the form of test parameters to perform DQ tests. The results of these tests generate a binary markup of 1's and 0's, i.e. flags indicating the presence
or absence of an error for a given dimension of DQ.
Overall, the workflow when using :ref:`DQMaRC <api.DQMaRC>` can be described in three key steps as illustrated in :ref:`figworkflow1`:

#. Identify and prepare the source dataset.
#. Identify and define the relevant metadata, test parameters, and data standards.
#. Analyse the DQ results.

The Shiny App User Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you prefer a graphical interface, please refer to the :ref:`Frontend ShinyPy Tutorial <Frontend_Tutorial>` section. 
This guide will walk you through the installation and use of the Shiny for Python interface to run DQMaRC without writing any code.
We have built a frontend graphical user interface using `shiny for python <https://shiny.posit.co/py/>`_ to encourage non-python users to use ``DQMaRC``.

You can access a serverless, web-hosted version here: `DQMaRC Shiny Front End <https://github.com/christie-nhs-data-science/DQMaRC/blob/main/DQMaRC_ShinyLiveEditor_link>`_. 
Please note this will run in your local web browser. For more information refer to `Shinylive web hosting <https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/shinylive.html>`_

If you installed ``DQMaRC`` using pip, you can also run the ``shiny app`` in terminal, bash, or Anaconda Powershell:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Serverless Web-Browser

        You can access a serverless, web-hosted version here: `DQMaRC Shiny Front End <https://github.com/christie-nhs-data-science/DQMaRC/blob/main/DQMaRC_ShinyLiveEditor_link>`_. 


    .. tab:: Cloned from GitHub

        If you cloned the `DQMaRC GitHub repo  <https://placeholder.link>`_:

        .. code-block:: console

            shiny run --reload --launch-browser "C:\Users\...\pip_env_dqmarc1\Lib\site-packages\DQMaRC\app.py"


    .. tab:: Installed via Pip

        Once you have installed ``DQMaRC`` using pip and have your pip or conda virtual environment setup, run the following code in terminal or anaconda powershell. 
        This will deploy the app.py script to your local web-browser at localhost. 
        Please adjust the directory string below to point to where you have DQMaRC installed. 

        .. code-block:: console

            shiny run --reload --launch-browser "C:\Users\...\Lib\site-packages\DQMaRC\app.py"

        To find the location of where you installed ``DQMaRC``, you can use the following command in terminal:

        .. code-block:: console

            pip show DQMaRC


Here is an overview of the front-end user interface. This is explained in more detail in :ref:`Frontend ShinyPy Tutorial <Frontend_Tutorial>` section.
